why we need linux...?
-----------------------
 ->open source Operation System.
 ->run faster  ( in windows, it needs to load grahics,)
 ->high security

===============================================
what is linux:-
---------------- 
   It is an open source community developed os.
    founded by Linus Torvald.

=======================================================

what is kernel..?
-------------------
   ->It is intermediate between the os and CLI.
   ->Kernel is responsible for managing system resource, cup, hardware,...
   
   => why we need shell scripting...?
     -------------------------------- 
          It is used to automate the task in the linux/unit environment.
              like 
                1. system monitoring 
                2. system resource allocation.
                3. backup of files.

   Note:-
   ------
     -> user communicate with the os, through a program called shell. 
=========================================================================
basic commands:-
-----------------
cd 
pwd 
ls  (with different flag).
mkdir 
cp 
mv 
rm
cat 
touch 
grep 
echo 
man 
head 
tail 
less
sort 
uniq
...... 
========================================================
copy and move:-
----------------
cp 
mv
========================================================
chmod:-  chnage mode.
-------
       -> It is used to alter the file permission associated with the file.

to chnages the file permission, we have different level of numbers 
from 0 to 7 

 0 =0 => nothing
 1 =1 => execute
 2 =2 => write 
 3 =2+1 =>write + execute
 4 = 4  => read
 5 => 4+1 => read + execute
 6 => 4+2 => read + write
 7 => 4+2+1 => read + write + execute. 

============================================================
what is Linux Shell:-
----------------------
  Linux is a command line interface, It allows the user to interact
  to linux os by typing some commands.


  Shell is a very powerful component of any Linux distribution
  that takes text commands from the user, interprets them,
  and interacts with system utilities and apps. As a result,
  you can carry out a long list of activities, such as creating files,
  monitoring processes, downloading files from the Internet, 
  and creating a database and text processing without leaving the shell. 

what is shell scripting...?
-----------------------------
 --> In shell script the list of commands are executed. 
 --> It makes the automate process.
============================================================ 
Bash shell --> Bourne Again shell, 
               It is the improved version of sh (Bourne shell)

=================================================================
Variables:-
------------
like other programming language , variable is used to store the value.
variable can contain (a to z or A to z ) and number (o to 9).

 i. readonly variable.
 2. unset variable.

readonly variable:-
--------------------
   ->It is same like static in other programming language.
   -> once we declare the variable value, we cannot modify it.

unset variable:-
--------------------
    -> if we want to delete or remove the variable then we can use unset command.

 system variable:-
 -----------------
  path
  pwd 
  date,...

======================================================================
user input:-
--------------
read 
Prompt String (-p)
=====================================================================
condition stmt:-
-----------------
  it checks for the condition, based on the condition , if its true it will
  execute the if block.
  for false it will execute else block.
     1. if-then-fi 
     2. if-then-else-fi
     3. if-then-elif-then-else-fi   (else if ladder)
     4. nested if 

1. if-then-fi 
     if[condition]
     then 
       stmt 1 
       stmt 2 
     fi      --------> end of the if      

===========================================================
commonly used operator
----------------------
   string1=string2 ---> true if both the string are equal.
   string1 !=string2 --> true, if both string are not equal.

   -eq 
   -gt 
   -lt 
   -ge 
   -le 
   ! 
   && 

   -r File -->true if is file exist and it is readiable 
   -w File  -->true if the file exists and writeable
   -x file  --> execute 
   -e file --> true if the file exists.

==========================================================
function:-
------------ 
  ->function is a block of code, which we can define, and call 
  where ever we want. 

     syntax:-
     --------
       function_name()
       {
          # body of the function.
       }

    
    eg:-
    -----
      # function without parameter.
       greet()
       {
        echo "welcome all"
       }

      #function call 
       greet

=============================================================
task 1:-
------  
    --> count the number of lines present in the file. 
        wc -l 
    
    --> print the file data line by line.    

===============================================================
Arrays:-
-------- 
  # varaible  ---> single values.
  name="sachin"  
   
  ->to store collection values in a single variable we use arrays.
  
  ->In Array the elements are stored in index, the index always 
  start from 0.

 syntax to create an array:-
 ---------------------------
    array_name=(value1 value2 value3 ...)

 syntax to access Arrayelement:-
 -------------------------------
     ${array_name[index_number]}.   


  2.Associate array:-
  ----------------- 
    It is like a key value.
      ->m - 38
      ->l - 39
      ->xl -40 

      india - delhi. 
      usa - washington. 
      franch - paris.

    sytax:-
    -------
    decalre -A array_name.
